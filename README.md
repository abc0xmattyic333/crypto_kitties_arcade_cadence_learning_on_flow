## Introduction

Crypto Kitties Arcade is a learning project aimed at teaching the basics of Cadence through interactive examples and exercises. By working through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with Cadence and the Flow blockchain.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Flow VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onflow.cadence)
